Overview
This Flutter application is part of a Diploma in Computer Engineering project focused on building an efficient Fuel Delivery System. The system consists of three separate apps:

* Admin App – Manages users, delivery personnel, fuel prices, and pumps.
* User App – Allows customers to order fuel from nearby pumps.
* Delivery Boy App – (This App) Used by delivery personnel to manage and fulfill fuel delivery requests.

About This App
This is the Delivery Boy app of the project. It enables delivery personnel to:

Receive delivery requests from users.
View customer details and location.
Mark orders as delivered.
Track delivery status.

The app supports delivery within a specific range around partnered fuel pumps. If all fuel pumps collaborate with the system, this service can scale to a wider region, allowing faster and more reliable fuel deliveries
